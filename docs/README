The Magi
Sabi. Simple, Lightweight, but Not Beautiful.

###############
# Quick Start #
###############

NOTICE: The full webserver edition of this software is only compatible with Linux.
NOTICE: For Linux machines, this package will install software from your apt sources: 
nginx and apache2. If your distro does not use apt, you can manually install nginx and apache2

To view your webserver:
	- After running The Magi each time, it will print a list of each ports being
	  used (also saved to ./magi/docs/myWebservers.txt).
	- In your web browser, go to localhost:portnumber (substituting port number
	  for the ports aforementioned) NOTE: If this is on a remote server, type
	  the IP address of that server instead of localhost.

To add webservers:
	- Make a directory/folder of albums of images and videos you want to include.
	- (Optional) Make a config file in magi/config. (See evangelion.conf for example)
		- There are four variables: category, title, banner, auth
			- category: Name of your directory
			- title: Title on browser tab
			- banner: Top headline for the website
			- auth: True/False/Unique
	- Put the new directory in ./magi/categories

To run The Magi and update HTML files and hosted servers:
	- Open your terminal
	- Navigate to where you installed The Magi
	- Type 'sudo python3 magi.py' (without the quotation marks)
	
To update The Magi to newest version:
	- Replace your current magi.py file with the newest version from this GitHub
	- You can check your current version with `python3 magi.py -v`

# Example #
###########

There is an included webserver with The Magi.  You must run magi.py once to get it setup, 
but beyond that it is accessible. If you have run magi.py and not added any other webservers, 
it will be available in your web browser at localhost:9001.  There you will find an example
from Hideaki Anno's Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise, the namesake for The Magi.  You can
navigate this webserver like any other website.

Inside magi/config/evangelion.conf, you will see how the configuration file is setup for this
evangelion webserver.  Inside magi/categories/ you will see a directory called evangelion.
This is the top level collection, the directory that will become the web server.  Inside
evangelion, there are two directories: web and subcategories. The web directory is all managed
by The Magi for you. The subcategories directory is where you will place your albums. The two 
albums included in our example: angels and characters.  Inside each of those albums are
a few pictures from the series.  

##################
# File Structure #
##################

Inside The Magi installation folder, there are five items:

 - Categories - Where you will add directories for each webserver. Inside each directory you add, 
	        there should be collections of media in separate directories.
 - Config - Where you will give The Magi the tools it needs to get you rolling. Simply create a new 
	    config file for each webserver, following the example provided.
 - Docs - README and list of current webservers

##################
# HTML Only Mode #
##################

The Magi supports an option to only generate the HTML files for your media. Currently, this is only 
worthwhile if you just want to update pages, but you don't want to change nginx backend. This will 
be adapted in a future update to allow for HTML documents to be able to function outside of an nginx 
build.

You can access this by running python3 magi.py --html-only
